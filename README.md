## Overview

These are a collection of very simple algorithms, implemented in Go, for the purpose of practicing for job interviews.

## Algorithms

### Graphs

There are implementation of both Depth-First and Breadth-First search algorithms, in the `graph` package.

`TODO`: add more algorithms, such as Dijkstra's, and Spanning Trees.


### Common

The `common` package contains a few common algorithms and utilities, such as:

- `Queue` and `Stack` implementations
- `BinarySearch` and `BinarySearchRecursive`

### Tests

`TODO`: add tests for all the algorithms.
